1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,190
this is a day

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:11,019
i've been looking forward to for
two-and-a-half years

3
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:14,234
every once in awhile

4
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:17,957
a revolutionary product comes along

5
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:23,480
changes everything

6
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,087
apple has been

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,521
well first of all was very fortunate

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,543
if you get to work on just wannabes

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,910
in your career

10
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,129
apples in very fortunate

00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:36,107
it's been able to

12
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:40,015
introduced a few of these into the world

13
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:42,083
nineteen eighty four

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,108
you choose the macintosh

15
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,025
villages change apple

16
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:54,025
it change the whole computer industry

17
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:02,093
in two thousand one

18
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:07,072
we choose the first pipeline

19
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:10,230
if interest

20
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:13,031
within this change the way we always the
music

21
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:20,031
it change the entire music industry

22
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:22,114
were introducing

23
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,101
three

24
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:30,003
revolutionary products of this class

25
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:33,078
the first one

26
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:40,078
is a widescreen high part with touches

27
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,014
the seconds

28
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:56,077
is a revolutionary the

29
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,152
and the third

30
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:05,086
is a breakthrough

31
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:12,086
internet communications device

32
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,083
three things

33
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,733
widescreen ipod with such controls

34
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,417
a revolutionary mobile phone

35
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:25,605
and a breakthrough internet
communications lines

36
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,870
an ipod

37
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,226
a farm

38
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,919
an internet communicate

39

unhide pa

40
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:42,369
canned old

41
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:45,792
these are not

42
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,040
three separate devices

43
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:54,653
decision one divide

44
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,707
the

45
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:57,882
haifong

46
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:02,034
and day and

47
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,384
today at fort is going to reinvent the
phone

48
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:08,764
and here it is

49
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:16,349
d

50
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:23,522
actually areas but we're gonna leave it
there for now

51
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,773
before we get into it

52
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,228
let me ask

53
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,892
when we talk about a category of things
the most advanced phones are called

54
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,246
smart phones

55
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,647
so they say

56
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:39,308
and uh... they typically combine a fong
plus some

57
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:44,090
email capability plus they say it's the
internet for the baby internet

58
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,075
into one device in they all have these

59
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:48,208
plastic little keyboards on them

60
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:51,295
uh... and of the problem is

61
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:52,426
they're not so smart

62
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:57,134
and they're not so easy use so if you
can make a

63
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,802
no business school one oh one graph of
the smart access and uh...

64
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:01,745
easy z-axis

65
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,069
phones regular cell phones are kind of
like they're they're not so smart

66
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,845
and iron you know i'm not so easy views

67
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:09,631
uh...

68
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,807
but smart phones are definitely will
smarter but they actually are harder to

69
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,421
they're really complicated just for the
basic stuff people have a hard time

70
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:20,277
figuring out how to use them

71
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,805
well we don't want to buy the one of
these things

72
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:26,672
what we want to do is michael leapfrog
product

73
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:27,740
that is

74
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:30,102
what a smarter than any mobile devices
ever been

75
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:32,079
and super easy use

76
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:38,083
this is what i felt

77
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,942
we're going to reinvent the phone

78
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:48,050
now we're going to start

79
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:52,674
with a revolutionary user interface

80
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:53,791
the results of the years

81
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,439
of research and development

82
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,580
and of course it's an interplay of
hardware and software

83
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:06,324
why do we need a revolutionary user
interface i mean here's four smartphones

84
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,090
right motorola q blackberry

85
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,198
palm treo

86
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,590
nokia e sixty two the usual suspects

87
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:15,065
what's wrong with their user interface
as well

88
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,487
the problem with them

89
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,368
is really sort of in the bottom forty
there

90
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,236
it's it's this stuff right here

91
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,841
they all have these keyboards bitter
there whether you need them or not to be

92
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:27,610
there

93
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,063
and they all have these control buttons

94
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,850
vip are fixed in plastic

95
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:35,151
and are the same for every application
every application once a slightly

96
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:36,131
different user interface

97
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:39,058
a slightly optimize set of buttons

98
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:40,099
just for it

99
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:44,101
and what happens if you think the great
idea six months from now you can't run

100
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:47,040
around at a button to these things there
are any ship

101
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,058
so what do you do

102
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:49,353
it doesn't work

103
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,710
because the buttons and the controls can
change

104
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:55,080
the key a change for each application

105
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:56,072
making change

106
00:05:57,044 --> 00:06:01,383
dan wrote if you think of another great
idea you want and for this product

107
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,330
well how do you solve this

108
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:06,041
it turns out we have solved that

109
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,670
we solve it in computers twenty years
ago

110
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,103
we solve it with a bitmap screen

111
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:16,762
the could displace anything we want put
any user interface up

112
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,330
and appointing device

113
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,108
we solve it with the mouse

114
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:26,307
we solve this problem so how are we
going to take this to a mobile device

115
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,381
what we're going to do

116
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,103
new is getting rid of all these buttons

117
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:32,522
and just make a giant screen

118
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:35,573
giants

119
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,300
how are we going to make it as we don't
carry around a mouse right

120
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:40,622
so what are we gonna do

121
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:41,993
a less violence right

122
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,660
where he is a stylist

123
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,800
now

124
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,770
now who wants a stylus

125
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:52,111
definitely around for a long way in the
wings and yes

126
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,620
nobody wants a styles

127
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,761
so let's not use the site

128
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:01,205
we're going to use the best pointing
device in the world where is the point

129
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:01,610
of ice they were all

130
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:04,152
warm with what's happened with news of
fingers

131
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:09,100
when the touch us with our fingers and
we have invented a new technology called

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,489
multi-touch

133
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:12,497
which is phenomenal

134
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:16,770
it works like magic

135
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:18,526
you don't need a stylus

136
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:23,307
it's far more accurate than any text
displayed its ever been shipped

137
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,162
ignores unintended touches it's super
smarts

138
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:31,650
multi finger gestures on it

139
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:38,065
and boy have we patented it

140
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,403
we've been very lucky

141
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:49,210
to abroad a few revolutionary user
interfaces to the market

142
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,330
in our time

143
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,570
first was the mouse

144
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,034
the second

145
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,840
was the click wheel

146
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:56,503
and now

147
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,860
we're gonna bring multi touch to the
market

148
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:01,155
and each of these revolutionaries around
faces

149
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:03,954
has made possible

150
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,536
a revolutionary product

151
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,388
the mac the ipod and now

152
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,015
the iphone

153
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:16,150
a revolutionary user interface we're
gonna build on top of that

154
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:21,037
with software now software on mobile
phones

155
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:23,058
like baby stuff

156
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:25,367
it's not so powerful

157
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:26,921
and today

158
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,275
we'll show you saw four breakthrough

159
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:30,750
software that's at least

160
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,128
five years ahead

161
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,029
of what's on any other phone

162
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,062
now how do we do this what we start

163
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,078
with a strong foundation

164
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:40,337
five phone runs all westinghouse

165
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:48,039
and

166
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:54,100
why would we want to run such as
sophisticated operating system

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,092
on a mobile device well because it's got
everything we need

168
00:08:58,092 --> 00:08:59,099
it's got multitasking

169
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:01,151
