1
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:06,012
this is a day

2
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:10,440
I've been looking forward to for two and
a half years

3
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:17,044
every once in a while

4
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:30,072
this is a day

5
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:39,099
this is a day I've been looking forward
to for two and a half years

6
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:46,099
every once in a while

7
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:50,179
a revolutionary product comes along that

8
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,082
changes everything and

9
00:00:55,082 --> 00:01:01,101
Apple has been well first of all one's
very fortunate if you get to work on

10
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:07,100
just wannabes in your career Apple's
been very fortunate

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,003
it's been able to introduce a few with
these

12
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:15,006
into the world 1984

13
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:20,007
we introduced the macintosh then just
change Apple

14
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:27,007
change the whole computer industry %ah

15
00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:35,038
in 2001

16
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:40,027
we introduced the first iPod and

17
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:46,376
if interest it didn't just change the
way we all this the music

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,670
it change the entire music industry well

19
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:55,806
today we're introducing

20
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:03,409
3 revolutionary products at this class

21
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:10,629
the first one is a widescreen iPod with
touch control by

22
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:24,079
the second is a revolutionary

23
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:31,079
the

24
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:38,148
and the third is a breakthrough

25
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:45,092
Internet communications device

26
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:50,099
no 3 thinks a wide screen iPod with
touch controls

27
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:54,144
a revolutionary mobile phone and a
breakthrough

28
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:59,130
Internet communications mice an iPod

29
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:05,072
of our own an Internet communicator

30
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,143
an iPod far

31
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:17,043
the K

32
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:20,116
these are not three separate devices

33
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:27,099
this is wonderful i the

34
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,128
and New York calling it iPhone

35
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,033
the

36
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,089
today

37
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,170
today Apple is going to reinvent

38
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:41,436
the farm and here it is

39
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:47,860
the

40
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:50,086
now

41
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:54,111
actually hear it is but we're gonna
leave it there for now so

42
00:03:55,011 --> 00:04:00,080
before we get into it

43
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:04,083
let me are let me talk about a category
of things the most advanced phones are

44
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:06,112
called smart phones

45
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:10,048
so they say and

46
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:14,074
they typically combine a follow-on plus
some email capability

47
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:17,169
plus they say it's the internets for the
baby internet in the one device and they

48
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,868
all have these

49
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,980
plastic little keyboards on them I and
other problem is

50
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:27,142
that they're not so smart and they're
not so easy to use

51
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:33,099
so if you can make a you know business
school 101 graphic smart axis summer

52
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:36,198
easy to use Access phones regular cell
phones are kinda like they're they're

53
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:38,115
not so smart

54
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:42,097
9 a.m. you know not so easy to use I am

55
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:46,100
but smart phones are definitely will
smarter but they actually are harder to

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,077
use

57
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:50,113
they're really complicated just for the
basic stuff

58
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:55,052
people have a hard time figuring out how
to use them well we don't want to either

59
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,061
one of these things

60
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:59,113
what we want to do is make a leap frog
product

61
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:04,030
that is way smarter than any mobile
devices ever been

62
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,090
and super easy use vs is what I phones

63
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:13,079
cock we're going to reinvent the phone

64
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,090
now we're gonna start

65
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:22,091
with revolutionary user interface

66
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:27,090
is the result in the years

67
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,088
I've research and development and

68
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,069
of course it's an interplay of hardware
and software now

69
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,133
why do we need a revolution or user
interface I mean here's

70
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:42,035
for smartphones right Motorola Q the
BlackBerry

71
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,092
Pond Trail Nokia e62 the usual suspects

72
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:48,111
and what's wrong with their user
interface as well

73
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:53,026
the problem with them is really sort of
in the bottom forty there

74
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:57,109
its it's this stuff right here they all
have these keyboards

75
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,107
that are there whether you need them or
not to be there and they all have these

76
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,015
control buttons

77
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:07,071
that are fixed in plastic and are the
same for every application

78
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:10,158
every application wants a slightly
different user interface a slightly

79
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:15,134
optimize ceta buttons just for it and
what happens if you think a great idea

80
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,041
six months from now

81
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,139
you can't run around add a button to
these things are already shipped so what

82
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,094
do you do

83
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:24,122
it doesn't work because the buttons

84
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:29,022
and the controls can't change they can
change for each application

85
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:33,070
and they can change down the road if you
think another great idea you want to add

86
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:33,090
to this product

87
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:38,074
well how do you solve this hmm it turns
out

88
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:42,085
we have solved it we solved in computers
twenty years ago

89
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:47,126
we solved it with a bitmap screen the
cosplay anything we want

90
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:52,030
put any user interface up and a pointing
device

91
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:57,069
we solved it with the mouse right we
solve this problem so how we gonna take

92
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:58,138
this to a mobile device

93
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,095
what we're gonna do is get rid of all
these buttons

94
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:06,111
and just make a giant screen a giant
screen

95
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:12,076
now how are we going to communicate this
we don't carry around a mouse right

96
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:15,090
so what we gonna do our stylists right

97
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:21,063
we use a stylus now who wants a stylus

98
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:25,079
you have to get home and put them away
you lose 'em

99
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,088
yuck nobody wants a stylus so let's not
use a stylus

100
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,090
we're going to use the best pointing
device in the world where he's appointed

101
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,026
by Stu Worrall

102
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:38,029
born with one with Taliban when he's our
fingers

103
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:41,082
wanna touch us with our fingers and we
have invented

104
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:45,131
a new technology called multi-touch
which is phenomenal

105
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:51,100
it works like magic you don't need a
stylus

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,071
it's far more accurate than any touch
display that's ever been shipped

107
00:07:56,071 --> 00:08:00,083
it ignores unintended touches it's super
smart

108
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,132
you can do multi finger gestures on it

109
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:08,037
and boy have we patented a

110
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:15,037
so

111
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:21,830
we've been very lucky to a broad a few
revolutionary user interfaces to the

112
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,155
market in our time

113
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:26,137
first was the mouse the second

114
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:30,040
was the click wheel and now

115
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:34,012
we're gonna bring multi-touch to the
market and each of these revolutionaries

116
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:35,087
are interfaces

117
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:39,624
has made possible a revolutionary
product

118
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,742
the Mac the iPod and now the iPhone

119
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,440
so a revolutionary user interface

120
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:50,060
we're gonna build on top of that with
software

121
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:55,060
now software on mobile phones is like
like baby soft for

122
00:08:56,014 --> 00:09:00,039
it's not so powerful and today

123
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,918
we'll show you saw for breakthrough
software that's at least

124
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:07,660
five years ahead what's on any other
phone

125
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:11,073
now how do we do this while we start
with a strong foundation

126
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:16,107
iPhone runs OST the

127
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:21,036
now

128
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,475
why

129
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,290
why would we want to run such a
sophisticated operating system

130
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:31,738
on a mobile device while because it's
got everything we need

131
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:35,007
it's got multitasking it's got the best
networking

132
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:39,883
it already knows how to power management
doing this on mobile computers for years

133
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,658
it Scott awesome security and the right
aP's

134
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:48,873
it's got everything from Coco and the
graphics and it's got core animation

135
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,344
built-in

136
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,600
and it's got the audio and video the
West End is famous for it's got all the

137
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:54,100
stuff we want

138
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:59,403
and it's built riding in to iPhone and
that has let us create

139
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:03,360
desktop class applications and
networking

140
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:07,325
right not the crippled stuff

141
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,723
that you find on most phones this is
real desktop class

142
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:16,478
applications you know one of the
pioneers of our industry Alan K

143
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,790
has had a lot of great quotes throughout
the years and I ran across one of them

144
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:21,838
recently

145
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:26,553
that explains how we look at this
explains

146
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:31,230
why we go about doing things the way we
do because we love software

147
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:36,232
and here's the quote people who are
really serious about software

148
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:41,480
should make their own heart now Allen
said this thirty-year

149
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:44,647
and this is how we feel about so we're
bringing

150
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,173
breakthrough software to a mobile device
for the first time

151
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,480
it's five years ahead of anything on any
other phone

152
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:55,637
the second thing we're doing is we're
learning from the iPod

153
00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:01,082
sinking with iTunes you know were gonna
shipper 100 millionth iPod this year

154
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:05,204
and thats all tens of millions of people

155
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,470
that know how to sync these devices with
their PCs or Macs

156
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:11,516
and sink all of their media right onto
the iPod

157
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,973
right see just drop your iPod in

158
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,284
and it automatically syncs you do the
same thing

173
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:15,240

resolution screen with ever shipped its

177
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,470
a 160 pixels per inch

178
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:35,956
highest with ever shipped it gorgeous
and on the front

179
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:39,408
there's only one button down there we
call it the home button take you home

180
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:40,680
from wherever you are

181
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,805
that's it a cycle the side

182
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,075
it's really thin it's thinner than any

183
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,423
smartphone out there at 11 points six
millimeters

184
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,693
better than the Q there in the black
check for them all

185
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,266
it's really nice and we got some
controls on the side we got all switch

186
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:00,103
for remain silent we gotta

187
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:03,651
volume up and down control so the back

188
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:07,278
on the back the biggest thing I've
noticed we got two megapixel camera

189
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:07,967
built right in

190
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:15,579
the other side were back on the front so
let's take a look at talk now

191
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,773
we've got headset jack

192
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,961
three and a half a millimeter all your
iPod headphones fit right in

193
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,576
we've got a place at all tray for your
SIM card and we got one switch for sleep

194
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:28,144
and wake

195
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,677
just push it to go to sleep push its
wake up was likely the bottom

196
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:39,035
we've got a speaker got a microphone

197
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,740
and we got our 30-pin iPod connector

198
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:46,160
so that's the bottom now we've also got
some stuff you can't see

199
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:50,705
we've got three really advanced sensors
built into this phone

200
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:55,321
the first was a proximity sensor it
senses when physical objects get close

201
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:55,593
to you

202
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,264
bring iPhone apps you're here take a
phone call

203
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,846
it turns off the display and it turns
off the touch sensor instantly

204
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:06,710
what do you wanna do that want to save
battery but to see docket sprees inputs

205
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:08,441
from your face

206
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:12,100
in a touchscreen just automatically
turns what takeaway boots back on

207
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:15,710
so it's got a proximity sensor built ins
got ambient light sensor as well

208
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:18,847
we sense the ambient lighting conditions
and adjust the brightness of the display

209
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:21,241
to match the ambient lighting conditions
again

210
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,802
better user experience say its power and
the third thing we've got

211
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,706
is an accelerometer so we can tell when
you switch from portrait to landscape

212
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:33,392
it's pretty cool show it to you in a
minute so three advanced sensors built

213
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,196
in

214
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,775
sup let's go ahead and turn it on

215
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:44,432
this is the size of it it fits
beautifully in the palm of your hand

216
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:49,074
so an iPod phone

217
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:52,757

00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,470
with on-screen controls

318
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:45,256
you know I was showing this to somebody

319
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,960
I was giving a demo to somebody a

320
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:51,108
little while ago who'd never seen this
before inside Apple

321
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:56,187
and I finished the demo said what do you
think he told me this

322
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:00,348
said he had school go

323
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:06,196
the iPhone with the most amazing iPod
ever

324
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,685
you can now touch music so that's the
iPod now

325
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,279
let's take a look revolutionary phone

326
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,610
we want to reinvent the phone now

327
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:21,250
what's the killer app the killer app is
making calls

328
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:26,801
it's amazing it's amazing

329
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:31,490
how hard it is to make calls on most
phones most people actually dial them

330
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:31,858
every time

331
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,306
most people don't have very many numbers
in their address book that use the

332
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:36,720
recent

333
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:40,084
as their address book right how do you
do that I bet more than a few

334
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:44,503
so we wanna let you use contacts like
never before

335
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:48,325
you can sync your iPhone with your PC or
Mac and bring down

336
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:51,960
all your contacts right in your phone
she got

337
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:55,105
everybody's numbers with you at all
times we have something

338
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:59,157
it's going to revolutionize voicemail
the day we call it Visual Voicemail

339
00:24:00,057 --> 00:24:05,057
wouldn't it be great if you didn't if
you had six voicemails Indianapolis in

340
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:08,756
the five of them first before you want
it was in the sixth will not be great if

341
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:11,220
you have a random access voicemail

342
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:15,931
what we've got just like email you can
go directly to the voicemails it

343
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:16,194
interest you

344
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:19,793
x1 all the audio quality

345
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,968
iPhone is a quad-band GSM plus edge
phone

346
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:29,090
we have decided we decided to go

347
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,078
with the most popular international
standard which is GSM or on that

348
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:34,070
bandwagon

349
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:38,556
headed on that road map and now plan to
make a 3G phones and all sorts of other

350
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,687
amazing things in the future so

351
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:44,210
quad-band GSM plus edge and of course we
have wifi

352
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:51,021
and Bluetooth 2.0 with the art building
as well so this is what it looks like

353
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:57,220
when you get a call is what sounds like
it's one of our ringtones you can pick

354
00:24:57,022 --> 00:24:57,083
up course

355
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:02,132

356
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:05,950

calendar and SMS

359
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:15,806
messaging the kind of things you would
find on a typical phone

360
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:20,820
very untypical way so let's go ahead

we want so as an example I come to my

00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:02,166
order I wanna listen to it with Visual
Voicemail

447
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:05,900
so that is a quick tour up the phone app

448
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:08,030
now what I want to do is show you SMS
texting

449
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:12,100
so I just go to the S&S icon in the
upper left hand corner

450
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,053
and push it and I not only have SMS
texting

451
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:21,128
but I have multiple sessions so I can be
carrying on conversations with people

452
00:31:22,028 --> 00:31:26,028
and every time I get a new message from
Mr be alerted to that might go check it

453
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:26,072
out so

454
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:30,096
as an example here I've got AQ and I've
been carrying on a conversation with any

455
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,100

456
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:34,070

457
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:37,046
right and if there's a new message to
missus new message from Phil

458
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:41,228

actually really fast the type of its

464
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:02,100

00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:50,101
Sparta life so what's this all about

516
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:55,067
well we've got some real breakthroughs
here start off with

517
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:58,128
we've got rich HTML email on iphone

518
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:03,036
the first time really rich email on a
mobile device

519
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:08,008
and it works with any I'm ap or pop
email service

520
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:11,026
get your favorite mail service it will
likely work with

521
00:36:11,026 --> 00:36:15,375
and its rich text email we

522
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:19,780
wanted the best web browser in the world
on her phone not a baby web browser a

523
00:36:19,078 --> 00:36:20,102
web browser

524
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:25,005
are real web browser and we pick the
best one in the world Safari

525
00:36:25,032 --> 00:36:28,057
and we have Safari running on iphone

526
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:31,084
it is the first fully usable HTML
browser

527
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:38,084
on a phone toward

528
00:36:41,038 --> 00:36:42,082
we have Google Maps

529
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:45,129

traffic

530
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:49,048
this is

531
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:53,076
on believable way to see it we have
widgets

532
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:57,094
starting off with weather in stocks and

533
00:36:57,094 --> 00:37:00,167
was communicates with the Internet over
edge and WiFi

534
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:04,159
an iPhone automatically detects wifi and
switches seamlessly to it you don't have

535
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:10,085
to manage the network it just does the
right thing now

00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:19,092
just put this in the landscape mode and
there it is right there

616
00:42:19,092 --> 00:42:23,173
and I can scroll here if I want scroll
up and down here

617
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:27,098

now

619
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:35,117
this is really great now I can see the
whole page but of course I can't read

620
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:37,031
it's all too small

621
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:41,039
so I get in with my fingers and pension
but we have an optimization I can just

622
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,127
double tap on anything in automatically

623
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:47,064
fills up the screen with and I can just
scroll around like this

624
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,075
school over here I can even make this
text bigger if I want to

625
00:42:50,075 --> 00:42:57,075
and there it is

626
00:43:02,048 --> 00:43:04,141
just double tap again to get back to the
